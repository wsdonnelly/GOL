### terminal version of Conway's game of Life
- run ./gol and two numeric parameters to set density and size of initial random state.
- the terminal window can be set to any size you wish
- ie. ./gol 18 10, where 18 is the density and 10 is the size of the inital state, in this case 1/10th of the terminal window
- runs 1000 times or ctrl^z or ctrl^c to end
